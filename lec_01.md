# Lecture 1

## Artificial Intelligence

* **Artificial Intelligence** - The Design and study of computer systems that behave intelligently
* Why is AI research important
  * Engineering aspect
    * Solving of hard problems
  * Cognitive aspect
    * Understanding the nature of human intelligence
   
## Intelligence and Machines

* **Can we make machines intelligent?**
  * Symbolic System Hypothesis
    * Intelligence is substrate neutral
      * The logic our brain performs can be the same as what a computer performs 
    * A physical symbol system has necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action
  * Biological substrate only
    * Intelligence is substrate dependent. THe material humans are made of is fundamental for our intelligence. Thinking is possible only in special machines - living ones made of proteins
   
## Evolution of an AI System

* **Reasoning vs Behavior**

  * The computational process or the end-product matters
 
* **Human performance vs Rationality**
  * Compare against a human model (with it's weakness) or a normative "ideal" model (rational system)
 
## RN Textbook

* The textbook adopts the _rational agent perspective_: **Focus on behavior and rational (normative) models**

* **Agent**: an entity that perceives and acts
  * On abstract level the agent maps percepts to actions

* **Design goal**: for any given environment find the agent that performs the best with respect to some normative model
* **Caveat**: The design may be limited by resources: memory, time
 
## Thinking Humanly: Cognitive Science

* 1960's "Cognitive Resolution": Information processing psychology replaced prevailing orthodoxy of behaviorism
* Requires scientific theories of internal activities of the brain
* Both approaches (Cognitive Science, and Cognitive Neuroscience) are now distinct from AI

## Thinking Rationally: Laws of Thought

* Normative (or perscriptive) rather than descriptive
* Aristotle: What are correct arguemnts/though processes
* Several Greek scholars developed various forms of logic
  * notation and rules of derivation for thoughts
* May or may not have proceeded to the idea of mechanization

## Rational agents

* An agent is an entity that percieves and acts
* This course if about designing rational agents
* Abstractly, an agent is a function from percept histories to actions:

* For any given class of environments and tasks, we seek the agent (or class of agents) with the best performance
