## Methods of Inference

* Entailment means that there is a needle (aplha) in our haystack (Knowledge Base)
* Inference: Given all the consequences of my model, is one of them aplha?
* Soundness: Is everything derived from the inference statement true with propositional logic
* Completeness: whenever alpha can be derived from KB, then alpha entails KB
